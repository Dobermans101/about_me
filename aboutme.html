<h1>I like Dobermans! A LOT!!</h1>
<p>Dobermans are my favorite dog breed of all. I don't know why they are but they just are. Did you know that dobermans ears are not naturally pointed like a wolves or a cats are. People cut their ears so they were not hanging down. The reson for cutting their ears is that they were used to hunt and their large ears could easily be snagged by the horns or antlers of the prey. Most dobermans are black with brown on their chest and other little patches on their body. Dobermans can also be dark brown, light brown, normal brown, or even white with the same markings.
History: A German named Louis Dobermann is credited with developing the Doberman pinscher breed in the late 1800s. He was a tax collector and wanted a fierce guard dog to accompany him on his rounds. Dobermann also kept the local dog pound, where he had access to many strays. Personality: Doberman pinschers are considered people-oriented dogs that are affectionate and sweet with people, if socialized and trained properly. They are loyal to their owners and are good with children if raised with them; however, some Dobermans bond only to one person. Because dogs are distinct individuals, it's difficult to ascribe a specific trait common to all members of a breed. Dobermans can be dangerous, but so can Chihuahuas and poodles. Dobermans have an undeserved bad reputation because of their service to the police and military, and because they look so competent. The Doberman Pinscher — Fleet-Footed Guard Dog. Developed in the 1800s by a tax collector looking for a canine bodyguard with the muscle power and the speed to catch and retain thieves, the black-and-tan Doberman Pinscher can accelerate to speeds of up to 30 mph. This is a working breed with an innate desire to protect.  Doberman pinscher – If you have a large piece of property that you are trying to protect, a Doberman pinscher is a great guard dog for you. ... Known as the fifth-smartest dog breed in the world, Dobermans are fearless, alert, and loyal dogs. </p>
