<h1>I like Dobermans! A LOT!!</h1>
<p>Dobermans are my favorite dog breed of all. I don't know why they are but they just are. Did you know that dobermans ears are not naturally pointed like a wolves or a cats are. most dobermans are black with brown on their chest and other little patches on their body. Dobermans can also be dark brown, light brown, normal brown, or even white with the same markings.</p>
